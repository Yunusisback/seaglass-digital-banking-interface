## ✨ Key Features

* **💎 High-End Glassmorphism:** The entire interface is built with `backdrop-blur-xl` and semi-transparent layers to achieve a realistic frosted glass feel.
* 
* **💳 3D Interactive Card:** The `CreditCardShowcase` component features 3D depth that physically responds to mouse movements, powered by `react-parallax-tilt`.
* 
* **🌌 Dynamic Vanta.js Background:** Utilizes a `Three.js` based Vanta (CELLS) effect, creating a living, deep, and interactive visual engine.
* 
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** A fluid structure specifically optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop screens.
* 
* **⚡ Modern Tech Stack:** Maximum performance and rapid development with **React 19**, **Vite 7**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.
